# dym-server

Did you mean(dym) is simple microservice that does spelling correction and word segmentation.
If you combine both you get something similar to Google's `Did you mean` kind of service.

This API Server is using Flask(Python Microframework) & Swagger 2.0(aka Open API)

It has a deployed version(API and [API playground](https://myapp.actualize97.hasura-app.io/v1/ui/)) on hasura, check them out

#### Autogenerated stubs

---------------------------------------------
## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.
